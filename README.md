This repo  includes the overview of the SAAJA 16K*19 Computer; the description of basic computer 
based on the knowledge of Basic computer of 4K*16 bits computer designed by Morris Mano. 
“SAAJA Computer” is a simple computer of size 16K*19 containing 14 bit address, 3 bit opcode and 
2 bit addressing modes. It has 19-bit registers, 19-bit common bus system, 14-bit address lines, 
7 Memory Reference Instructions, 12 Register Reference Instructions and 6 Input Output Instructions. 
The basic concept of architecture and organization of computer design, with all the necessary 
functional components to be working as a real computer, is covered in this paper which is simple to 
understand and comprehend the workings of computers and also assists in further understanding of more 
complex computer architecture.
